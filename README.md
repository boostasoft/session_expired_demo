# session_expired_demo
Suppose you are developing an application that deals with sensitive user data, and you want that when the user does not interact directly with the application for a certain period of time, the application closes his session and sends him back to another activity that can be a lock screen in the application or even a return to the login screen. If this is your case, then the code in this demo will be of great help.
